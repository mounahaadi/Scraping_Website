I'm Kataoka.<br/> - And I'm Imamura.<br/><br/>I've been contacting my home and my wife's cell<br/><br/>but I couldn't get through.<br/><br/>To be safe, we will be going in first.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Mr. Kataoka!<br/><br/>Yumi!<br/><br/>Should I call an ambulence?<br/><br/>No, there is no need.<br/>I am a doctor.<br/><br/>It's anemia.<br/>It's her constitution.<br/><br/>Yumi? Yumi.<br/><br/>Are you okay?<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>So then, regarding the phone call.<br/><br/>Did it have anything to do with your daughter?<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>Kidnapped... they said they took Mayu.<br/><br/>I got a call from Mayu's cellphone.<br/><br/>I picked it up thinking it was Mayu and was told that.<br/><br/>Was it a man's voice?<br/>A woman's voice?<br/><br/>It was a man.<br/><br/>Perhaps in his 30s.<br/><br/>Did he give his name?<br/><br/>Uh, something about the Revolution or...<br/><br/>Must be the Leaders of the Revolution.<br/><br/>And? What else did he say?<br/><br/>He said he will not call here again.<br/><br/>You said he's not calling here again, right?<br/><br/>Yes, but just in case,we have to be ready.<br/><br/>So she was targeted because <br/>she's Kunitake's grandchild!<br/><br/>I'm sorry.<br/><br/>It seems Mayu was absent from cram school today.<br/><br/>Did you hear anything about this?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Well, then, does she have any<br/>friends she usually plays with after school?<br/><br/>Friends...<br/><br/>Is she always in the house,<br/>not even trying to make friends?<br/><br/>That's why I can't trust you with anything!<br/><br/>But she never talks to me about anything.<br/><br/>Father.<br/><br/>Yumi, what were you doing?<br/><br/>And you call yourself a politician's daughter!<br/><br/>I'm sorry.<br/><br/>You aren't the one's facing the full brunt of this.<br/><br/>I am!<br/><br/>I'm truly sorry.<br/><br/>- Um, right now, more than blaming...<br/>- Who are you?<br/><br/>- Metropolitan Police Special Investigatio-<br/>- Who is in charge here?<br/><br/>That would be me.<br/><br/>- Have we met...?<br/>- Yes.<br/><br/>I had been assigned as your escort.<br/><br/>It has been a while.<br/><br/>Huh, so a non-career detective is in charge, then.<br/><br/>Excuse me, that was rude.<br/><br/>In any case, have the Metropolitan Police, <br/> National Police Agency, and Public Safety<br/><br/>work together and investigate this case <br/>until it is resolved.<br/><br/>Yes, sir.<br/><br/>More this way.<br/><br/>There.<br/><br/>Look here.<br/><br/>Have you given any thought to the ransom's meaning?<br/><br/>1085 trillion yen...<br/>Just about one quadrillion yen.<br/><br/>They aren't being very realistic.<br/><br/>It's Japan's total budget deficit <br/>at the end of the last fiscal year.<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Even the criminal has to know that there's no way<br/>we can prepare one quadrillion yen.<br/><br/>In that case...<br/><br/>It wouldn't be strange if he is thinking politically.<br/><br/>Plus, he's calling himself \"Leader of the Revolution\"<br/><br/>Public Safety is gonna be all over this case.<br/><br/>No doubt.<br/><br/>Our priority is the hostage's safety.<br/><br/>As you are aware,<br/><br/>aside from his eldest daughter Yumi,<br/>Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake<br/><br/>has a son, Mr. Kazuyuki, who followed in his footsteps<br/>and became a member of the Diet.<br/><br/>He has two young children as well.<br/><br/>Which means the criminal <br/>deliberately targeted Ms. Yumi's daughter.<br/><br/>The politican has strict security at his side<br/>that would have prevented it.<br/><br/>What is the home situation of the Shinoda family?<br/><br/>Mr. Kataoka<br/><br/>Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake's<br/>eldest daughter Yumi<br/><br/>married a doctor, Mr. Shinoda Yuichi<br/>12 years ago.<br/><br/>The kidnapped Mayu is their only child.<br/><br/>Three times a week, <br/>Mayu goes to the cram school by Azabudai Station.<br/><br/>That day, cram school was in session, but she was truent.<br/><br/>We estimate that the kidnapper acted<br/><br/>while she was going from <br/>elementary school to cram school.<br/><br/>Any witnesses?<br/><br/>From the initial stage of inquiry, <br/>there are no witnesses.<br/><br/>We reviewed the surveillance footage from around <br/>the station, but we found no evidence.<br/><br/>But how is it that a 10-year-old child<br/>was kidnapped without anyone seeing it happen?<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>Why did the culprit bother to call the mother?<br/><br/>I wonder...<br/><br/>Since he announced his demands through the media...<br/><br/>Excuse me!<br/><br/>The media networks have received a second message!<br/><br/>Here is the attached image.<br/><br/>She is holding today's evening newspaper.<br/><br/>It's the second message from the criminal.<br/>I will now read it.<br/><br/>\"We the Leaders of the Revolution have prepared <br/>two options for the Japanese government.\"<br/><br/>\"Option One\"<br/><br/>\"To pay the previously requested 1085 trillion yen.\"<br/><br/>\"This amount is our country's fiscal deficit<br/>from the end of last year.\"<br/><br/>\"The dawn that we receive it\"<br/><br/>\"we intend to use it to help reduce the deficit.\"<br/><br/>- That's so much!<br/>- There's no way we can arrange that!<br/><br/>So it's a political crime after all.<br/><br/>\"Option 2\"<br/><br/>\"Take responsibility for the financial crisis,<br/>and for the sake of the nation,\"<br/><br/>\"present a formal apology<br/>and a concrete economic recovery plan.\"<br/><br/>\"By 9AM tomorrow, please announce <br/>which option you will take on television.\"<br/><br/>\"We hope for a response from the Prime Minister<br/>or former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake.\"<br/><br/>That's it.<br/><br/>They want us to respond within 12 hours.<br/><br/>Chief, do you want to make this an open investigation?<br/><br/>All we can do is wait for the Official Residence <br/>to make a move.<br/><br/>[Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake]<br/><br/>Why so focused on Kunitake?<br/>[Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake]<br/><br/>Why so focused on

eat, you'll die.<br/><br/>If you die, it'd be a real problem for me.<br/>So eat.<br/><br/>- These fur seals, are they eloping?<br/>- I wonder!<br/><br/>But they seem to get along well.<br/><br/>- This is going to cause a commotion again.<br/>- It's an idyllic sort of news, isn't it.<br/><br/>Yes, it's healing.<br/><br/>Uh, we have just received word<br/><br/>that the Metropolitan Police Department<br/>will be holding an emergency press conference.<br/><br/>Yesterday morning<br/><br/>a student attending the metropolitan area<br/>Motoazabu Private Elementary,<br/><br/>Shinoda Mayu,<br/>was kidnapped while returning from school.<br/><br/>But the criminal appeared to be targeting<br/>the Prime Minister or Kunitake.<br/><br/>It means they've left the decision for someone else.<br/><br/>Do you mean you've been contacted by the criminal?<br/><br/>Yes. To prevent intereference with the investigation<br/>we unfortunately cannot provide details<br/><br/>But from the criminal's statement we can assume<br/><br/>the criminal is a man in his 30s<br/>who is strongly discontented with society.<br/><br/>He has great Internet expertise<br/>and there is a possibility of multiple offenders.<br/><br/>Can we please have some more information?<br/><br/>We cannot provide any more detail.<br/><br/>Are you saying you cannot present<br/> the kidnapper's statement?<br/><br/>Wasn't there a demand for a ransom?<br/><br/>I cannot answer that question.<br/><br/>I am addressing the criminal.<br/>If I do this now, we can still make it.<br/><br/>Please release the hostage as soon as possible.<br/><br/>We and the government,<br/>we are lending our ears to your voices<br/><br/>and are preparing for this discussion.<br/><br/>That is all.<br/><br/>- Why won't you release the criminal's statement?<br/>- What is the ransom?<br/><br/>- Answer us!<br/>- Tell us why!<br/><br/>So, shall we start it from this end?<br/><br/>Woah, that's crazy! What is that?<br/><br/>A quadrillion yen?<br/><br/>The criminal's statement got leaked to the Internet?<br/><br/>Leaked?<br/><br/>It was posted to a bulletin board site<br/>and it's being spread via social networks.<br/><br/>Did the media leak it?<br/><br/>No, the risk would be too great.<br/><br/>The culprit likely released it after seeing the interview.<br/><br/>So he's determined to be showy with this.<br/><br/>We just received one more message.<br/><br/>I'll display it on the monitor.<br/><br/>\"Please make this the last time<br/>you put off a client of the government.\"<br/><br/>\"If you do not take action<br/>and abide by the September 16th deadline\"<br/><br/>\"we cannot guarantee the survival of the hostage.\"<br/><br/>Can you trace the sender of this message?<br/><br/>They used multiple foreign servers to send it.<br/><br/>Meaning, our culprit has Internet expertise on his side.<br/><br/>Understood.<br/><br/>It sounds like we've received instruction<br/>from the Prime Minister.<br/><br/>Our country does not surrender to any kind of terrorism.<br/><br/>For the dignity of the nation, let us rescue Miss Mayu<br/><br/>and arrest the criminal before the deadline.<br/><br/>Extra!

very familiar with her<br/><br/>I think he was calling her \"Saori\".<br/><br/>Is that Hashimoto Saori?<br/><br/>I believe that's possible.<br/><br/>A man against the government, Ito Naoya,<br/><br/>knowing his own death was imminent,<br/><br/>and fighting his loneliness, began a blog.<br/><br/>Through this, Hashimoto Saori introduced him to Mayu,<br/><br/>and the kidnapping was planned and executed.<br/><br/>Hmm, it's frustrating.<br/>It's still just conjectures.<br/><br/>Should we further question Hashimoto Saori?<br/><br/>We need to investigate her thoroughly.<br/><br/>That, and do a full investigation of Ito Naoya.<br/><br/>- We're going to headquarters.<br/>- Yes sir.<br/><br/>\"To the news media:\"<br/><br/>\"Finally, it's

and Shinoda Mayu.<br/><br/>This is not a regular political crime.<br/><br/>It was a revolution that two lonely people<br/>put their lives toward.<br/><br/>So Ito brought the message to the mother for Mayu?<br/><br/>He wanted to put an end to her lonliness.<br/><br/>But he doesn't have much life left.<br/><br/>So he wanted to appeal to the mother's conscience.<br/><br/>Because the mother responded to that<br/><br/>Mayu's revolution came to an end.<br/><br/>That's why she went back to school.<br/><br/>In that case Mr. Kataoka<br/><br/>where is Ito's revolution,<br/>his own revolution,
